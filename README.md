# CIS2750 - Software Development and Integration

This repo features 4 parts of the assignment where a4 is the finished application
with node.js, C (GPX-Parser), and SQL database for data. This application reads GPX files
and parses them allowing the user to add multiple routes and segments while also having 
the option to create custom files using the front-end. 

## A1 
- develop a backend GPX file parser in C
- extract data into custom data structures
- ensure no memory leaks that can cause vulnerabilities in code

## A2
- write functions to compute data and validate file
- convert extracted data to JSON strings and can be passed to a JavaScript file

## A3
- write the "glue" that binds the backend C to the .js file by allowing parsing in the server-side
- develop GUI for the frontend application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the client-side
- implement server functionality with routes/endpoints (API) using Node.js with callback functions

## A4
- design a database using MySQL for storing GPX data in a server
- add connectivity of database to the client-side
